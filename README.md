# Impossible Sudoku Generator
fun, quick and dirty 'IMPOSSIBLE' sudoku generator

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>A CLI based sudoku puzzle generator. Only catch, It's 'impossible to solve'. Basically, a usual sudoku solver, without backtracking, reversed.</p>

<h2> Why even?</h2>
<p>I was typing out a quick sudoku solver which would use backscripting when my grandmother asked my what's the point of doing that when she could solve it in minutes. So I removed the backscripting and made an 'impossible' sudoku generator. Technically, if it doesn't have a viable solution, it's not sudoku but as I said, it's fun and gamesðŸ˜‚</p>
